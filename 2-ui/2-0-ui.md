# User Interfaces (UI)

Most software and apps require a user interface that make it easy to interact with the software. On the web, interfaces are made using HTML, and CSS. 

It can be useful to know how to make these interfaces to allow users to interact with the code you write which is why this series will go over the absolute basics of HTML, CSS, and how they can be used together to make decent interfaces. 

Towards the end of this section, we will also look at how to use JS to add logic to your web pages.

## HTML

HTML stands of Hyper Text Markup Language. Every single website is made using HTML. It defines the head, and the body of your webpage. The head gives your website identity, and the body gives it structure. There are libraries and frameworks (React, Svelte, etc.) which power up HTML with the help of JS. Understanding how HTML and JS works will allow you to utilize these tools more effectively.

## CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) add styles to your web pages. You can use styles and CSS to design your web pages the way you want. There are plenty libraries and frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) which allow you to styles your website easily but understanding CSS is the key to using them effectively. This series will solely focus on using pure CSS.
