# Programming and Software Development

## What is Programming?

Progamming is the process of creating programs. Programs are a series of instructions that computer can understand and execute. Computers work with data. The programs that you write can tell the computer to create and manipulate data. Understanding data is crucial to understanding programming and how it works.

## What is Data?

Data is a collection of facts. In the real world, you get gather this data through observations. Imagine there is a blue car on the road. 
- What color is it? - Blue! 
- What type of vehicle is it? - A car! 
- How many wheels do you see? - Four! ("umm actually there can be... ðŸ¤“". Just assume there are four for now.)
- Who is the manufacturer? - ... don't know (assuming you didn't imagine it. If you did, forget it for a second).

Our brains are able to analyze the data that we gather almost instantly and are able to generate useful information based on that. We know that vehicle is blue, is a car and hence has four visible wheels. We do not know the manufacturer yet. If I tell you that the car is a Honda, now we know that the car is a Honda (pretty redundant but that is pretty much how data is processed). Information refers to data that has been processed and has meaning.

### What is Data for a Program?
Everything is data for a program. Any text file, any image, any audio or video is considered data by machines. The user provides the data and it is the role of a software to understand this data and provide you with the information is needed.

Let's take a social media service as an example. The basic function of any social media service is to:
- allow you to create posts
- allow users who are follow you to view your posts

When you are creating a post, you sending *data* to the service. The data that you send can include: 
- the poster (you)
- the contents of the post (text, images, etc.)
- the time when the post was created

This data is sent to the servers, and is then stored in a database. Whenever someone wants to view your posts, the server searches for your posts in the database, packages it in a way and sends it over to the application (called a client). The application then understands this data and presents in an appropriate way. (This was an example of a very basic client-server system)

Understanding data can make understanding software development an easier endeavour. The next part explains how programs understand data.
