# DEV101

## Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive written series intended to serve as a guiding resource for individuals who possess minimal or no prior experience in the field of software development. The series is aimed towards absolute beginners. This will be helpful for you if:
- you have never written a program but are interested in software development
- you have worked on a few projects but would like a more structured introduction to programming in general

In this series, we go through some general concepts about software development and programming and then understand how to make a software. I will mostly focus on web technologies in this series as web apps are quite popular and are easier to make and reach out quite easily to a larger audience. The technical stuff included in this series talks a bit about HTML and CSS (for the UI) and uses JavaScript/TypeScript for programming.

## Motivation

TLDR: see last paragraph

I have always been fascinated with computers and how software is made. My journey in the realm of software development began in 2017 with a very basic website for a school project. I worked on a few other small personal projects just for fun. After that, I became interested in making chat bots for Discord which increased my interest in this field.

My first bot was pretty bad but I was able to see the weather while chatting on Discord which was pretty exciting (this was the time when self bots weren't outright banned, the good old days). Over time, I tried to add more features to the bot but my attempts would fail. The reasoning behind these failed attempts at making a bot became clearer as I started working on other projects and got into university.

The issue lied in my lack of fundamentals. I was excited to make a project but I never really tried to understand how to write a *decent* program. The tutorials I followed were very limited in the information they provided and if I tried to do anything beyond the scope of the video, chances are that it would not work as desired.

I am creating this series while keeping in mind my early days in the world fo software development. The contents included in this series are the topics that I wish I was informed about software development and the topics I had understood when I was getting started. 

## FAQ

### 1. What language should I start with?

**It depends** on what your goal is. Most languages these days can do pretty much anything you want. Some languages are better (in terms of experience and performance) than others in the tasks they specialize in. The table below lists down some languages along with their *tracks* (what they can be used for). This list is **not comprehensive**:


| Track | Languages |
|---|---|
| Web Development | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| App Development | Java (Android), Swift (iOS), JavaScript (Cross Platform) |
| Software Development | Java (Cross Platform), C# (Windows Apps), C++ (Drivers and OS) |
| Games | C# (Unity), C++ (Unreal Engine)  |
| Machine Learning / AI | Python |

That being said, there are some languages which are easier than others and can be useful for beginners to get started. My personal recommendations would be to start with one of JavaScript, Pythonm, or Java. These languages are quite friendly and easy to understand and are quite commonly used in software development as well.

### 2. Do I need a Computer Science degree to get better at software development?
**No. It is not a requirement. However, it certainly helps.** Software Development and Computer Science are very different from one another. The former deals with the creation of software and the latter focuses on the internals and the functioning of a computer. You certainly don't need to know how a computer works internally to make most software but having an understanding of the system is useful when you need/want to make optimized/performant applications or are creating a software which dives really deep and works on the lower levels.

### 3. Do I need to be good at math?
**No.** Having a decent understanding of algebra is all you really need to get started.
