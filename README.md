# DEV101

## Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive written series intended to serve as a guiding resource for individuals who possess minimal or no prior experience in the field of software development. The series is aimed towards absolute beginners. This will be helpful for you if:
- you have never written a program but are interested in software development
- you have worked on a few projects but would like a more structured introduction to programming in general

In this series, we go through some general concepts about software development and programming and then understand how to make a software. I will mostly focus on web technologies in this series as web apps are quite popular and are easier to make and reach out quite easily to a larger audience. The technical stuff included in this series talks a bit about HTML and CSS (for the UI) and uses JavaScript/TypeScript for programming.
