# Getting Started

In order to get started, you will need a tool to write code, and an environment to run programs.

## Code Editors

While Notepad or TextEdit works, please do not use it as they do not provide any support. You have two options, text editors (aimed at writing code) or IDEs (integrated development environments). Both allow you to write programs. IDEs are more complex as they can perform many tasks related to development (testing, debugging, etc.). Some text editors can perform the same tasks by adding plugins. For this series, we will stick to text editors and will be using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

To assist us in development, and providing a live preview of the HTML that is written, we will be adding an extension to VSCode.

### Windows Users Only

You will need another extension if you will be using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (optional, but recommended):

## Setting up the Environment

Next, we will need to set up the environment. Linux and macOS are more popular for development due to the stability they offer. If you are running either of these systems, you are good to go.

### Windows Users Only 

You could write programs and run them directly on Windows through Command Prompt or PowerShell but I recommend installing WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) which creates a virtualized Linux environment for you. By default it will install Ubuntu for you which works well for us.

It is also preferred to use Windows Terminal if it is not installed.
